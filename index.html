    <h1>Ron Cagle is not a robot</h1>
    <img src="images/ron.jpg" alt="A picture of Ron Cagle" title="Def. not a robot">
  <p>While it hasn't been confirmed that Ron Cagle is a robot we will for the time being, assume he isn't. What is known? Ron is a rare breed of Georgia "native". Ron's house is very clean, which is exactly something an android would do to blend in. When he's not denying being a robot Ron enjoys the following in no particular order. Why you could almost say this list is...unordered. 
  	<ul>
  		<li>Go fishing!</li>
  		<li>Dreaming about peer reviewed block chain forms of goverment</li>
  		<li>Listen to pop/trap/metal really loud</li>
  		<li>Listen to other music at a reasonable volume</li>
  		<li>Lurk on <a href="https://reddit.com/r/desirepath">Desire Path</a></li>
  		<li>Eat anything my gf cooks</li>
  	</ul>

  	<p>A great way to understand Ron is with a real quote from his girlfriend (who is not a robot)</p> 
  	<blockquote>You talk more than anyone I've ever met</blockquote>.
  	<p>Ron once asked his creator how long he's been loud to which she replied</p>
  	<blockquote>Honey you chewed food as a baby loud...</blockquote>
  	<p>Although the data hasn't confirmed if Ron was built or born it does confirm he's always been loud. Even his quiet is kinda loud.</p>
