  	<p>A great way to understand Ron is with a real quote from his girlfriend (who is not a robot)</p> 
  	<blockquote>You talk more than anyone I've ever met</blockquote>.
  	<p>Ron once asked his creator how long he's been loud to which she replied</p>
  	<blockquote>Honey you chewed food as a baby loud...</blockquote>
  	<p>Although the data hasn't confirmed if Ron was built or born it does confirm he's always been loud. Even his quiet is kinda loud.</p>
